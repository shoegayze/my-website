            <p>
                Seraplushies began with a simple idea: that everyone, no matter their age, deserves a bit of comfort, joy, and magic in their lives. Our founder, Sera, grew up surrounded by plushies that served as her companions, her confidants, and her sources of comfort. Each plushie held a special place in her heart, and as she got older, her passion for collecting and creating these soft treasures only grew stronger. She realized how much happiness a single plush could bring, and that’s when the idea for Seraplushies was born. </p>
                <br>
                
                <p>In 2022, Sera started Seraplushies as a small online shop, driven by her love for all things soft and cuddly. She began by handcrafting her own plushie designs from her small studio apartment, pouring heart and creativity into each stitch. Her first collection was modest but meaningful—each plushie carried a story, a little spark of joy, and an invitation to bring warmth to someone’s day. Friends and family were her first customers, but word quickly spread. People were drawn to the unique charm and personality of Sera’s creations, and soon, her small boutique began to blossom into something more. </p>
            
                <p>Despite the growth, Seraplushies has always stayed true to its roots. Sera’s original vision was never just about selling plushies—it was about creating a space where people could reconnect with that childlike sense of wonder, where a soft, huggable friend could lift your spirits after a tough day. Each plushie sold at Seraplushies is more than just a product; it's a companion ready to bring warmth and smiles. </p>
